        <h1>TEXAS ROADHOUSE ROLLS</h1>
        <h3> INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups whole milk, 105-110 degrees F</li>
            <li>1 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>Combine milk, yeast and honey in a small bowl; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
            In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with dough hook attachment, beat the milk mixture, butter, egg, salt and 2 cups flour on medium-low speed until a smooth batter forms, about 1-2 minutes.
            Gradually add remaining 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a soft, smooth ball of dough is formed. The dough should feel elastic and slightly tacky to the touch. Increase speed to medium-high and beat for 3 minutes.
            Lightly oil a large bowl or coat with nonstick spray; place dough in bowl, turning to coat. Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
            Gently deflate dough by punching down. Working on a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Fold in half, gently pressing the edges to seal. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough again into a 12×8-inch rectangle; cut into 15 rolls.
            Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place rolls onto the prepared baking sheets. Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 30-45 minutes.
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Place into oven and bake until golden brown, about 14-16 minutes.
            Serve warm, brushed with butter, if desired.
