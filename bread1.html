        <h3> INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup warm water, 100-110 degrees F</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature, divided</li>
            <li>3 ¼ cups all purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>Combine water, sugar and yeast in a small bowl; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
            In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with dough hook attachment, beat the water mixture, butter, 1 egg, 2 cups flour and salt on medium-low speed until a smooth batter forms, about 1-2 minutes.
            Gradually add remaining 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a soft, smooth ball of dough is formed. The dough should feel elastic and slightly tacky to the touch. Increase speed to medium-high and beat for 3 minutes.
            Lightly oil a large bowl or coat with nonstick spray; place dough in bowl, turning to coat. Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
            Gently deflate dough by punching down. Working on a lightly floured surface, divide into 8 equal pieces, weighing the pieces as needed; shape each piece into a smooth ball.
            Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place rolls onto the prepared baking sheet; flatten each ball to 3 inches. Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
            In a small bowl, whisk together remaining egg and milk. Brush tops of dough with egg mixture; sprinkle with sesame seeds.
            Place into oven and bake until golden brown, about 15-18 minutes.
