        <h1>WHOLE WHEAT PITA BREAD</h1>
        <h3> INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups warm water, 100-110 degrees F</li>
            <li>1 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups whole-wheat flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine water, yeast and honey; let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
            In a large bowl, combine flours. Stir in 1/2 cup flour mixture into the yeast mixture until smooth. Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
            Using the dough hook, gradually add olive oil, salt and remaining 2 1/2 cups flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, until a soft, smooth ball of dough is formed. The dough should feel elastic and slightly tacky to the touch. Increase speed to medium-high and beat for 3 minutes.
            Lightly oil a large bowl or coat with nonstick spray; place dough in bowl, turning to coat. Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
            Gently deflate dough by punching down. Cut into 12 pieces, shaping into a ball. Using a rolling pin, flatten each ball into a 5-inch round.
            Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Place rounds onto the prepared baking sheets. Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand in a warm spot until dough has doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
            Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Place into oven and bake until puffed, about 5-8 minutes.
            Serve warm.
