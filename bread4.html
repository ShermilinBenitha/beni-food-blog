        <h1>EASY NO KNEAD BREAD</h1>
        <h3> INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups warm water, 100-110 degrees F</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>In a large bowl, combine flour, salt and yeast. Create a well in the center; add water.
            Using a wooden spoon or your hand, stir until a wet, sticky dough forms, about 1-2 minutes.
            Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at a warm place until doubled in size and surface is dotted with bubbles, about 6-8 hours.
            Working on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, fold dough over itself 3-4 times, turning after each fold; gently shape dough into a round.
            Cover with a clean dishtowel and let stand at room temperature until dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.    
            Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place a 4-qt Dutch oven, covered, in the oven for at least 30 minutes.
            Remove Dutch oven from the oven; working carefully, place dough into the Dutch oven using the parchment paper as a sling.
            OPTIONAL: Using a sharp knife or bread lame, make a few shallow cuts on the top.
            Cover and place in the oven; remove the lid after 30 minutes. Continue baking until golden brown and completely cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 210 degrees F, about 15 minutes more. Let cool 30 minutes on a wire rack
            Serve warm.
